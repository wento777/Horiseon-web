# Horiseon-Web



 ## Description 

- This project was designed as a homework assignment for KU coding bootcamp in Module 1
HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor.

- Developers write code, but they also write about code. Take a moment to search the web for tutorials about any of the subjects you’ve learned so far in this course. You’re likely to find thousands of tutorials written by developers of all skill levels, but especially by junior developers—like you!

- Testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.

- A major aspect of this challenge was the balance between figuring out which solution made sense and the solution that would be most efficient.

- Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!

- There are two types of challenges in this course. Each one is designed to prepare you for a scenario that you're likely to encounter as a web developer.
* On-the-job ticket or feature request challenges give you starter code in a folder called Develop, which you'll modify to complete the challenge. Odd-numbered modules follow this format.
* Job-seeking coding assessments or take-home assignments don't provide starter code. You'll build these from scratch. Even-numbered modules follow this format.

- Challenges adhere to a format that's commonly used by software development teams that use agile project management to manage their work. Practicing this will prepare you for the workflows you'll experience as a professional full-stack web developer.

- Each Challenge contains the following elements:

User Story: This is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who is requesting the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. This follows an AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format. For example, "AS A shopper visiting an online store, I WANT to place items in a shopping cart, SO THAT I can purchase them."

Acceptance Criteria: These are the requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work. They are not exhaustive, but they do entail the minimum aspects of a working solution. Consider this a checklist of baseline requirements. Acceptance criteria can be presented in various ways. In this case, we'll use a common format called scenario-oriented criteria which expresses each requirement in a WHEN / THEN format. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense now; it will become very familiar to you after you complete a couple of challenges.

Mock-up: This is an image or animation that demonstrates the design and functionality of the web application that you'll build for the Challenge.

Submission: You'll submit your completed Challenge for review. In the real world, when a developer finishes working on a project, another developer reviews the code, providing feedback on errors and making sure that all of the acceptance criteria have been met. For each Challenge, your instructional staff will serve as your team of reviewers.

 ## Installation

  - Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!

  - Before you start, clone the starter codeLinks to an external site..

 



## Usage

  - Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!

  - Instead of creating a repository, you’ll publish a GitHub gist. GitHub describes a gist as a simple way to share code snippets with others. It’s also an ideal way to demonstrate a technique, teach a principle, or show off a solution

  -  It functions just like a repository, and you’ll use Markdown to create it, just as you do with your READMEs. Gists can include code, images, links, and anything else you can include in a README.

  - After you’ve cloned the starter code, learn how to create a gistLinks to an external site.. You can also watch this video on how to use gists.
     
 - The starter code is a template with a title, introductory paragraph, summary, and table of contents. The table of contents should link to sections of the tutorial that describe the functionality of each component in the regex. Be sure to rename the template to a unique name that describes your tutorial.

-This week is an odd-numbered week, so your Challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
  


## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines



## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Summary

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.
